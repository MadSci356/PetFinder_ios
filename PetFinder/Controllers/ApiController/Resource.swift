 ### Makes it easier to configure Rest calls.
 Each kind (Type) of a network call can have it's own formula for configuring the various things that go into REST calls
 These include: url, body, headers fields etc.
 
 ### Resource abstracts out those configuration params so that you can have custom versions for each type of resource.
 For example: an auth token Resource will be pre-configured with http body that
 will ask the API for a token with a POST call.
 Then, a PetFinder Resource will be use that result to configure itself with an auth token to make a GET call
